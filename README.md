# CatRancher
Description:
This repository contains a puzzle-based video game where the user takes on the role of a common house cat. The user will navigate their way through each level which offers a different puzzle for the user to solve. From hearding stray cats, to collecting cans of tuna, this game can offer a great way to pass time for all ages. This was developed as a school project for the 'CS:476 - Foundations of Game Development' course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. The group consisted of the five members whos names will be listed below. We had a lot of fun developing this game and have recieved all great reviews from everyone who has played it so far. For legal reasons we do NOT have any intentions of profiting off of this game.
